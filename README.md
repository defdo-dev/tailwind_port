# TailwindPort

A robust, production-ready Elixir library for integrating Tailwind CSS CLI with comprehensive error handling, health monitoring, and synchronization features.

The `Defdo.TailwindPort` module provides a reliable interface to interact with the Tailwind CSS CLI through Elixir ports, enabling seamless integration of Tailwind CSS build processes into Elixir applications with enterprise-grade reliability and monitoring.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://defdo.hexdocs.pm/tailwind_port), the package can be installed
by adding `tailwind_port` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tailwind_port, "~> 0.3.0", organization: "defdo"}
  ]
end
```

Then, run:

```sh
mix deps.get
```

## Features

### 🚀 **Production-Ready Reliability**
- **Critical Timing Fix**: Resolved race condition where CSS was generated but lost due to port termination timing
- **Immediate CSS Capture**: Implemented callback system that captures CSS before port termination can occur
- **Multi-layer Fallbacks**: Immediate capture → file-based → degraded → emergency fallback for 100% reliability
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper `{:ok, result}` or `{:error, reason}` return types
- **Automatic retry logic** with exponential backoff for port creation failures
- **Input validation** for all public APIs with descriptive error messages
- **Graceful process cleanup** to prevent orphaned OS processes

### 🔄 **Port Synchronization**
- **Port readiness detection** - `ready?/2` to check if port is operational
- **Synchronous startup** - `wait_until_ready/2` for reliable port initialization
- **Configurable timeouts** to prevent hanging processes
- **Race condition elimination** with proper synchronization mechanisms

### 📊 **Health Monitoring & Metrics**
- **Real-time health monitoring** - `health/1` provides process metrics
- **Activity tracking** - monitors port outputs, CSS builds, errors, and uptime
- **Enhanced telemetry** with detailed metrics and structured events
- **Process lifecycle visibility** for better observability

### 🔒 **Security & Validation**
- **Binary verification** - downloaded binaries verified for size and platform signatures
- **Secure HTTPS downloads** with proper certificate validation
- **Input sanitization** - all user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Platform-specific signature checking** (PE, Mach-O, ELF)

### ⚙️ **Configuration Management**
- **Config validation** - validate Tailwind configuration files
- **Default config creation** - automatic setup of sensible defaults
- **Effective config resolution** - utilities to resolve configuration from various sources
- **Syntax validation** for Tailwind configuration structure

## Usage

### Binary Download Configuration

If you publish a custom Tailwind CLI build, set the binary path explicitly and
keep the allowed download size aligned with the artifact you distribute:

```elixir
config :tailwind_port,
  path: System.get_env("TAILWIND_PATH", "/opt/defdo/bin/tailwindcss"),
  max_binary_size_bytes: 150_000_000
```

For production releases, prefer baking the binary into the image and using the
configured path above. Runtime download should stay as a fallback, not the main
release strategy.

### Binary version verification

An installed binary is checked against `:version` before it is reused. A binary
that reports a different version is replaced, because a file existing at the
expected path says nothing about which CLI it actually is — the file name
carries no version, and a sidecar marker records what the installer intended,
not what it wrote.

If you bake the binary into the image, set `:version` to the version you baked.
Otherwise the first install call replaces it:

```elixir
config :tailwind_port,
  path: "/opt/defdo/bin/tailwindcss",
  version: "4.3.3"
```

To keep whatever binary is on disk regardless of `:version`, turn the check off:

```elixir
config :tailwind_port, verify_binary_version: false
```

A binary that cannot be interrogated (not executable, or printing no version
banner) is left in place and logged, never replaced silently.

The check compares versions, not builds: a custom CLI and the stock upstream
one report the same version string, so this will not detect a binary from the
wrong source at the right version.

### Basic Usage

```elixir
# Start the pooled Tailwind manager (usually in your supervision tree)
{:ok, _pid} = Defdo.TailwindPort.start_link()

opts = [
  input: "./assets/css/app.css",
  output: "./priv/static/css/app.css",
  content: "./lib/**/*.{ex,heex}",
  config: "./assets/tailwind.config.js"
]

html = ~s(<div class="text-red-500">Hello</div>)

{:ok, result} = Defdo.TailwindPort.compile(opts, html)
IO.puts(result.compiled_css)

# Pool-level KPIs and telemetry-ready metrics
stats = Defdo.TailwindPort.get_stats()
IO.inspect(stats.derived_metrics)
```

### Legacy Single-Port API

If you need direct control over a single Tailwind CLI process (for example when
embedding the port in a custom supervision tree), use the `Standalone` module:

```elixir
{:ok, pid} = Defdo.TailwindPort.Standalone.start_link(opts: ["-w"], name: :legacy_port)

:ok = Defdo.TailwindPort.Standalone.wait_until_ready(:legacy_port)
health = Defdo.TailwindPort.Standalone.health(:legacy_port)
```

### Health Monitoring

```elixir
# Get comprehensive health metrics
health = Defdo.TailwindPort.Standalone.health()

IO.inspect(health)
# %{
#   created_at: 1706364000000000000,
#   last_activity: 1706364120000000000,
#   total_outputs: 15,
#   css_builds: 3,
#   errors: 0,
#   uptime_seconds: 120.5,
#   port_active: true,
#   port_ready: true,
#   last_activity_seconds_ago: 2.1
# }
```

### Configuration Management

```elixir
alias Defdo.TailwindPort.Config

# Ensure config exists (creates default if missing)
:ok = Config.ensure_config("./tailwind.config.js")

# Validate existing config
case Config.validate_config("./tailwind.config.js") do
  :ok -> IO.puts("Config is valid!")
  {:error, reason} -> IO.puts("Config error: #{inspect(reason)}")
end

# Get effective configuration
config = Config.get_effective_config(opts: ["-w", "-m"])
# %{watch_mode: true, minify: true, ...}
```

### Error Handling

```elixir
# All functions now return proper error tuples
case Defdo.TailwindPort.new(:my_port, cmd: "/invalid/path") do
  {:ok, state} -> 
    IO.puts("Port created successfully!")
  {:error, :max_retries_exceeded} -> 
    IO.puts("Failed to create port after retries")
  {:error, reason} -> 
    IO.puts("Error: #{inspect(reason)}")
end
```
