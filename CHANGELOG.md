## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Fixes
- **A compile returned the PREVIOUS compile's CSS.** `Pool.compile/2` started
  the CLI before writing the operation's content, so the run that produced the
  output had compiled whatever was already on disk; the caller then accepted
  that file because the pool's `last_output_mtime` baseline was recorded after
  that same run. The result was an off-by-one reported as success — content A
  compiled, then A's output returned for content B — and, in a fresh OS
  process, an output file left by an earlier run returned as if it were this
  one's result. Content is now staged (and the baseline taken) before any port
  exists.
- **Ports started without `--watch` are no longer reused.** That CLI compiles
  once and exits, so a second operation on the same pooled port had nothing to
  rewrite its output: the wait ran to timeout and returned the earlier artifact
  as `readiness: :degraded`. Non-watch ports are now retired after use and a
  fresh run is started; watch-mode ports stay poolable, which is what the pool
  is for.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-07-11

### ✨ Features
- Pool-managed default paths: when a compile operation omits `:input`,
  `:output`, or `:content`, the pool now derives stable scratch paths from
  the operation's option hash (under `tmp_dir/tailwind_port/`). Callers get
  full file-based compilation — instead of degraded stdout capture — without
  creating or cleaning up temp files themselves. Paths are deterministic per
  logical configuration, so port reuse and config caching are preserved.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-19

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Make the Tailwind binary upper size limit configurable through `config :tailwind_port, max_binary_size_bytes: ...` instead of hardcoding `100MB`.
- Raise the default maximum download size to `150_000_000` bytes so current Defdo-distributed Linux binaries can be downloaded without failing with `:binary_too_large`.
- Keep binary verification in place while allowing hosts to raise or lower the size ceiling explicitly for future runtime-managed versions.

### 📚 Documentation
- Document the recommended release contract for custom Tailwind binaries: bake the binary into the image, point `:tailwind_port` at the installed path, and leave runtime download as a fallback.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-02-18

## [0.3.3] - 2025-11-23

### 🚨 Major Bug Fixes
- **Tailwind CLI Version Compatibility**: Fixed critical port creation failures when using TailwindCSS v4.x.x
  - **Root Cause**: `build_start_args/1` was passing v3-specific CLI options (`--content`, `--config`, `--postcss`) to v4, which rejects them
  - **Solution**: Implemented `Defdo.TailwindPort.CliCompatibility` module with automatic version detection and option filtering
  - **Impact**: Eliminates "invalid option in list" errors and enables seamless v3/v4 coexistence

- **Keyword Processing Bug**: Fixed `FunctionClauseError` in `Keyword.do_reject/2` due to type mismatch
  - **Root Cause**: Passing string lists to functions expecting keyword lists
  - **Solution**: Clean refactor with proper type handling and conversion
  - **Impact**: Restores all pool functionality and eliminates crashes

### ✨ Major Architecture Improvements
- **New CLI Compatibility Module**: `Defdo.TailwindPort.CliCompatibility`
  - Automatic detection of TailwindCSS version from configuration
  - Version-aware filtering of CLI arguments (v3-only vs v4-only options)
  - Helper functions for option validation and migration
  - Complete backward compatibility while supporting v4 new features

- **Enhanced PortManager Support**: Added TailwindCSS v4 CLI options
  - `--cwd`: Working directory specification for v4 auto-content-detection
  - `--optimize`: Performance optimization without minification
  - `--map`: Source map generation support
  - Maintains full backward compatibility with v3 options

### 🔧 Code Quality & Performance
- **Pool.ex Refactor**: Complete cleanup of `build_start_args/1` function
  - **Before**: 40+ lines with redundant variable extraction and complex conversions
  - **After**: 25 lines with clear extraction → filtering → conversion flow
  - **Benefits**: -37.5% code reduction, improved readability, enhanced maintainability
  - Eliminates redundant keyword list reconstruction and unnecessary temporary variables

- **Telemetry Performance Fix**: Resolved telemetry handler performance warning
  - **Root Cause**: Using local function capture `&handle_default_event/4` which causes runtime performance penalty
  - **Solution**: Changed to module capture `&__MODULE__.handle_default_event/4` and made function public
  - **Impact**: Eliminates performance warning and improves telemetry handler efficiency

- **Enhanced Telemetry**: Increased slow compilation threshold from 5s to 15s
  - **Rationale**: TailwindCSS v4+ with plugins (DaisyUI) legitimately takes 1-3s for complex builds
  - **Impact**: Reduces false positive alerts while maintaining meaningful performance monitoring

| 3.x.x | ✅ Fully Supported | All legacy options |
| 4.x.x | ✅ Fully Supported | v4 new options + auto-filtering |
| Mixed Environments | ✅ Supported | Automatic detection and adaptation |

### 🚀 Performance Impact
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues to work unchanged
- **Improved Startup Time**: Faster pool initialization with cleaner argument processing
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Eliminated redundant temporary keyword list construction
- **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Better handling of version mismatches with graceful degradation

## Migration Guide from 0.1.x to 0.2.0

### Update Function Calls
```elixir
# Before (0.1.x)
result = TailwindPort.new(name, args)

# After (0.2.0)
{:ok, result} = TailwindPort.new(name, args)
# or with error handling
case TailwindPort.new(name, args) do
  {:ok, result} -> result
  {:error, reason} -> handle_error(reason)
end
```

### Replace Timing-Based Code
```elixir
# Before (0.1.x)
{:ok, pid} = TailwindPort.start_link(opts: opts)
Process.sleep(3000)  # Unreliable!

# After (0.2.0)
{:ok, pid} = TailwindPort.start_link(opts: opts)
:ok = TailwindPort.wait_until_ready(TailwindPort, 5000)  # Reliable!
```

### Add Error Handling
```elixir
# Before (0.1.x) - could crash
TailwindPort.start_link(name: "invalid", opts: "invalid")

# After (0.2.0) - graceful error handling
case TailwindPort.start_link(name: "invalid", opts: "invalid") do
  {:ok, pid} -> pid
  {:error, reason} -> Logger.error("Startup failed: #{inspect(reason)}")
end
```

### Use New Monitoring Features
```elixir
# New in 0.2.0 - Health monitoring
health = TailwindPort.health()
Logger.info("Port uptime: #{health.uptime_seconds}s, CSS builds: #{health.css_builds}")

# New in 0.2.0 - Port readiness
if TailwindPort.ready?() do
  # Port is ready for work
end

# New in 0.2.0 - Configuration management
:ok = Config.ensure_config("./tailwind.config.js")
config = Config.get_effective_config(opts)
```
